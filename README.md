# python-calculator-project

Project Overview

This is a simple Python project that allows users to convert between three common units of length: inches, feet, and yards. The program prompts the user to input the starting unit, the unit they want to convert to, and the measurement value, and then it performs the conversion.

Features

Converts between inches, feet, and yards.
Supports input for both the starting unit and target unit.
Provides results with the appropriate conversion calculation.
Technologies Used

Python: Basic Python functionalities including input, conditional statements, and mathematical operations.
Built-in Functions: Usage of standard functions such as input(), print(), and type casting (e.g., int()).
How It Works

The program first asks the user to input the unit they wish to convert from (inches, feet, or yards).
Then, it asks the user for the unit they want to convert to (inches, feet, or yards).
After that, the user is prompted to input the measurement in the starting unit.
The program performs the appropriate conversion based on the input and prints the result.
Conversion Logic
Inches to Feet: 1 inch = 1/12 foot
Inches to Yards: 1 inch = 1/36 yard
Feet to Inches: 1 foot = 12 inches
Feet to Yards: 1 foot = 1/3 yard
Yards to Inches: 1 yard = 36 inches
Yards to Feet: 1 yard = 3 feet
